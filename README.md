Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department wants me to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. 

Rockbuster's management team asked me to clean and profile their data and to answer some questions about customers location and payment.
